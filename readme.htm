    <h2>Requirements
</h2>
    <p>This source code uses various tools / libraries. You need to obtain a license for each of the following applications / components before you can compile the sourcecode into a working application:
</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Embarcadero Delphi, version 2007 and up: <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi">http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi
</a></li>
      <li>Developer Express VCL components: <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/VCL/">http://www.devexpress.com/Products/VCL/
</a></li>
      <li>Add-in Express VCL: <a href="http://www.add-in-express.com/add-in-delphi/">http://www.add-in-express.com/add-in-delphi/
</a></li>
      <li>GDIplis.dll, comes with most versions of Windows
</li>
      <li>libeay32.dll: library that is used for ssl connections.
</li>
      <li>libssl32.dll: library that is used for ssl connections.



</li>
    </ol>
    <p>[1] is the compiler. <br>[2] is a set of controls that is used to make the application look pretty. This includes nice edit controls, skinning controls and a layoutcontrol. <br>[3] is a set of controls that is used to hook into Outlook, add the button to the ribbon and various menu's and add an extra tab in the settings screen.
</p>
    <p>[5] and [6] are part of the OpenSSL Windows binaries that can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html">http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html</a>
</p>
    <h2>How-to
</h2>
    <p>Extract all sourdce in a directory, while maintaining the directory structure. The .dpr files are the project files and there are two of them:
</p>
    <ol>
      <li>FBPlugin.dpr is the project for the Outlook plugin
</li>
      <li>FBNewCase.dpr is a project that creates a stand-alone application for submitting cases. Mostly used for debuggin purposes.
</li>
    </ol>
      <p>Both projects can be opened and compiled at once into a working dll or exe. The dll must be registered to make it work in Outlook. You can create an installer with InnoSetup (<a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
</a>). The project file for InnoSetup is in the _Installer folder.
</p>
      <h2>Background
</h2>
    <p>I created this plugin because I needed it myself. Because it turned out to be very usefull for me I thought others might want to use it too, so I created the installer and wrote a blog about it. This blog still receives about 500 pageviews a month, but I don't know how many readers actually download and use&nbsp;the plugin. Since the plugin works for me and has all the functionality I need, I don't really have the urge to update it or add new features. That's too bad, since there are probably a lot of good ideas out there. At the request of the nice folks at FogCreek and some people that e-mailed me&nbsp;I release the source, hoping that someone will pick it up.
