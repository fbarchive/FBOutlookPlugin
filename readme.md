## How-to

Extract all sourdce in a directory, while maintaining the directory structure
The .dpr files are the project files and there are two of them:

1. FBPlugin.dpr is the project for the Outlook plugin
2. FBNewCase.dpr is a project that creates a stand-alone application for submitting cases. Mostly used for debugging purposes.

Both projects can be opened and compiled at once into a working dll or exe.
The dll must be registered to make it work in Outlook. You can create an installer
with InnoSetup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).
The project file for InnoSetup is in the `_Installer` folder.

## Background

I created this plugin because I needed it myself. Because it turned out to be very usefull
for me I thought others might want to use it too, so I created the installer and wrote
a blog about it. This blog still receives about 500 pageviews a month, but I don't know
how many readers actually download and use the plugin. Since the plugin works for me and
has all the functionality I need, I don't really have the urge to update it or add new
features. That's too bad, since there are probably a lot of good ideas out there.
At the request of the nice folks at FogCreek and some people that e-mailed me
I release the source, hoping that someone will pick it up.
